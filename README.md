## Work Experience

**Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in Java/Python (_August 2024 – Present_)**
University of Arizona, Computer Science Department
- Assist in delivering course content by providing in-class support and facilitating discussions.
- Hold office hours to help students troubleshoot and debug code, ensuring understanding of computer science concepts.
- Contribute to grading assignments, exams, and developing course materials in collaboration with instructors.
- Partner with faculty to enhance the learning experience and promote student success in computer science courses.
- Courses Taught: Intro to Computer Science (Java), Python Programming.

**Coding for Data (Data Wrangling with SQL) (_May 2025 - July 2025_)**
The Global Career Accelerator
- Participated in an intensive, project-based SQL bootcamp focused on real-world data analysis and data wrangling. Applied SQL to clean, query, and join datasets from platforms like YouTube, DoorDash, Zillow, and Uber. Attended live lab sessions with instructors to reinforce concepts and debug queries in real time. Developed a portfolio project analyzing sustainability data for Intel, simulating real industry use cases. Also completed training in cross-cultural communication and building a professional online presence.


## Projects
### Auto-Planner-Scheduler
[Project](https://github.com/Chance-Krueger/Auto-Planner-Scheduler)

A future GUI-based application (with planned design and JAR file) that will function as both a calendar and scheduler. It will automatically allocate time for events you input, helping you manage your schedule more efficiently and stay organized. The application will use custom algorithms—rather than AI—to determine the most efficient and effective schedule. It will dynamically update your schedule based on new inputs or changes, ensuring it stays optimized. More features and enhancements are planned for future updates.

### Server-POS-GUI
[Project](https://github.com/Chance-Krueger/Server-POS-GUI)

This Java GUI application simulates a restaurant server's tasks. Run LoginFrame to start. Users can log in or create an account to seat tables, take orders, print/pay bills, and view tips. A special manager login (management / Manager!123) provides access to sales data and item statistics. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design and makes use of HashMaps, enums, and encapsulation best practices.
