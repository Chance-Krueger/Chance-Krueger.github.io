## About Me

Hey, I’m Chance Krueger. I grew up in San Diego and now live in Tucson, where I’m studying Computer Science at the University of Arizona with a Business Administration minor.

I'm passionate about software development—especially backend systems—and aim to build a career as a software developer. I’m also exploring DevOps and cybersecurity on the side to stay well-rounded in tech. I currently hold certifications in "Querying Data" (Intel) and "Python and Data" (Recording Academy), and I’m actively working on more certifications and personal projects to deepen my skills and keep learning.

Outside of coding, I played baseball and golf most of my life, and I’m a big fan of college basketball and football. I enjoy being part of driven teams and am always looking for new opportunities to grow, contribute, and build impactful systems.

## Projects
### Auto-Planner-Scheduler

[Link to Auto-Planner-Scheduler](https://github.com/Chance-Krueger/Auto-Planner-Scheduler)

A future GUI-based application (with planned design and JAR file) that will function as both a calendar and scheduler. It will automatically allocate time for events you input, helping you manage your schedule more efficiently and stay organized. The application will use custom algorithms—rather than AI—to determine the most efficient and effective schedule. It will dynamically update your schedule based on new inputs or changes, ensuring it stays optimized. More features and enhancements are planned for future updates.

### Server-POS-GUI

[Link to Server-POS-GUI](https://github.com/Chance-Krueger/Server-POS-GUI)

This Java GUI application simulates a restaurant server's tasks. Run LoginFrame to start. Users can log in or create an account to seat tables, take orders, print/pay bills, and view tips. A special manager login (management / Manager!123) provides access to sales data and item statistics. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design and makes use of HashMaps, enums, and encapsulation best practices.
